Cringing at  the zero gravity acid ballet bullshit, the completely unnecessary Ash AI slop, the constant ‘bring me up to speed via the vid-screen’ recap, the accelerated gestation period. The actor playing the synthetic was a thin thread preventing the film from falling apart and me from switching off, until ‘get away from her [awkward beat] you bitch’ – Did he just look at the camera? He just looked at the camera! He winked! He fucking winked! URHG!!! – It took too much from the original while saying nearly nothing original. I kept thinking ‘what does this remind me of?’ and then I remembered. Star Wars The Force Awakens. Can you pander to hardcore fans while pulling in a whole new generation? No.",
