## Natural cycles

A proper mixed bag of weather this week. It looks like we’re in for another cold spell which I’ll take over rain any day.

## Gardening

### Organic

The garden is looking pretty bleak and I’ve not really spent any time thinking or doing. I should change that.

### Digital

This is the first time an entry has gone beyond the calendar week. My intention for [cycles](/collecting/cycles/) was to afford more writing flexibility. I wanted to avoid the guilt of not meeting self-imposed deadlines of weeknote, which in this case it has done. I can foresee entries that span over multiple weeks could suffer but I suspect that important moments will bubble up.

I managed to write and submit [my post for January’s Indieweb Carnival](https://benjamin.parry.is/writing/2025/01/indieweb-carnival-friction/) just in the nick of time. January was hosted by [Venkatram on the topic of friction](https://vhbelvadi.com/indieweb-carnival-friction). [Joe Crawford](https://artlung.com) is up next and his topic of affirmations is already rattling around in my brain.

Saturday saw the [photography outing](/collecting/photos/2025/02/brighon-photography-bimble/) Al Power, Paul Robert Lloyd and I have been talking about finally materialise. It was a grey and cold day in Brighton but it gave me the impetus to learn more about my camera. I’m looking forward to the next one already thinking about a theme to add some constraints to the exercise. Check out [Al’s photos](https://www.alpower.com/photos/camera-wander-on-a-grey-day).

## Work cycles

The pieces of the jigsaw have been slowly slotting into place this week. Everyone I’m working with have been very open and thoughtful in their approach for the next few weeks in February.

As I was heading into Brighton on Thursday evening for the UXup meetup, Al Power and I took the opportunity to try out the co-working space WRAP together. I was really impressed with the space and facilities. It had a certain honesty about it that made me feel at home. If you’re interested to learn more, I added it to my [list of co-working spaces](https://benjamin.parry.is/collecting/lists/co-working-spaces/).

I finally reciprocated a bowl of Goemon ramen to Bevan Stephens over lunch. It was wonderful to catch up with his news, a bit of a rant about AI, and somehow I unintentionally convinced him to buy a ticket for Research by the Sea. There’s a few people coming I haven’t seen in a long time, so I’m looking forward to ‘getting the band back together’.

After an afternoon of demos and chatting with Al, we both headed to the UXup meetup to continue more expertise sharing and hanging out with the lovely Brighton UX and design community.

## (Bi)cycles

Sunday offered up conditions for a crunchy and smooshy ride from Lewes to Iford and back. The sun was just out and ground still frozen to ride my frequent route with it being an absolute sludgefest but enough to warrant a long overdue bike wash. I too a few photographs after being inspired by Saturday’s trip. The temperature is forcast to drop again so I’m making plans to get up obscenely early and go for a big adventure.
