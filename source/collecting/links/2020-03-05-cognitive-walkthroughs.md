> 2. Identify the tasks you must complete to accomplish that goal
> 3. Document the experience while completing the tasks

Cognitive walkthrough questions:

> * Will users understand how to start the task?
> * Are the controls conspicuous?
> * Will users know the control is the correct one?
> * Was there feedback to indicate you completed (or did not complete) the task?
> * _Was there feedback to indicate you completed (or did not complete) the task?_
