What is democratization?

> …the reality is that democratization is about being a good navigator and a good passenger.

How does it work?

> You want to be able to partner with other disciplines, set expectations, and educate, enable, and empower them to be rigorous in their curiosity.

What is the value?

> …any work we can do to help others with systems, processes, tools, and programs will make their work more impactful and give them a deeper understanding of why our expertise is valuable.
