@johncutlefish shares his observations of why teams find success metrics challenging and how to help them make more impactful progress.

1. Uncertainty is a good thing, it means there is opportunity to learn and make change.
2. Be flexible. Follow the spirit of experimentation and try something different.
3. Create a culture of safe failure and encouraged learning.

> Consider the term "success metric". We've already jinxed the effort. We are already afraid of failing and learning.
