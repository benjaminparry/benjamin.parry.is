A fascinating talk about the state of AI and the role of ethics to navigate the potential benefit and harm it could bring.

> I see ethics and responsibility in technology, I see them as radical optimism. I see a community choosing to pursue a future that brings the benefits of technology and AI to everyone, that doesn't leave social impacts to just a few people or the whims of the powerful.
> 
> So I see this sort of commitment to values really as a trellis. That's the analogy I like to use, that the products and the services of the future will take on the shape of the values that we decide upon today.
