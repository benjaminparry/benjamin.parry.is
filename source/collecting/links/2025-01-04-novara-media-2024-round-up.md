I’ve grown very fond of the journalists of Novara Media. I particularly liked Ash Sarkar’s closing hopes for 2025.

> Thinking about human relationships and our experience of each other and our experience of the world and how corroded it's been by various logics of disposability and so this is thinking about consumerism and thinking about what does it do to us to buy so many items which are designed to be thrown away what does that make us feel about our own labor what's our relationship to our own labor.
> 
> There are so many technological means of which are supposed to Foster human connection which are based on the the idea of throwing people away it's just swiping infinite swiping infinite scroll like.
> 
> I found it really depressing when I was on dating apps I haven't been on dating apps for a while but when I was on them just like looking at all these hopeful faces and just being like “nope”. I don't think that's good for us I don't think it's good for us mentally I don't think it's good for us politically.
>   
> I think that there maybe some lines of connectivity that you can draw between the production of things um our economic conditions our working conditions our social conditions and our mental conditions as well.
