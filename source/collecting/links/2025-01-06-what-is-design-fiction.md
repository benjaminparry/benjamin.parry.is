A concise and effective video introduction to design fiction from the folks at Near Future Laboratory.

> In simple terms, design fiction is like archeology for the future.

> Design fiction isn’t focused on the movie star. It’s interested in the production design in the corner of the frame. Design fiction isn’t obsessed with the latest glossy device. He wants to know what’s written in the little Terms and Conditions slip.

> So that’s design fiction, the practice of creating tangible and evocative prototypes from possible near futures to help discover and represent the consequences of decision making.
