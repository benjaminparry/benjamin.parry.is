Musk:

> The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training. That happened basically last year.
>
> The only way to then supplement that is with synthetic data where … it will sort of write an essay or come up with a thesis and then will grade itself and … go through this process of self-learning.

Also Musk:

> The cumulative sum of sustenance has been exhausted in binge eating. That happened basically today.
>
> The only way to then supplement that is with human feces where … it will sort of resemble chocolate ice cream or be the next McDonald’s and then will digest itself and … go through this process of self-nourishment.
