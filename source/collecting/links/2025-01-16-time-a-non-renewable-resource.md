@apolaine@pkm.social 100% this! I’ve always loved the idea of flipping the power dynamic of a job interview. I’ve often told people asking for career advice that “A job interview is as much about you deciding whether they are the right match for you”. Time as a non-renewable resource is brilliant framing!
