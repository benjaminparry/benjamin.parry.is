An absolute surprise banger of a strategy and design podcast. So many sparks of ideas and quotes:

> When you're developing a strategy you have to do some sub optimal things to get to a better place

> Shut up and listen

- Remote enables a diverse audience
- The power of listening
- Nonviolent Communication
- Present something » move to a breakout space » do something… but NO q&a
- Building solidarity with people (in-person) by embodied ‘doing’
- Create a pathway to action – [The Steps Collective](https://smithery.com/steps-collective/)
- Breakout groups FTW: create empowerment by enabling everyone gets time to speak – [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/)
- A social conditioning that other people are disposable (similar topic in a recent [Trashfuture](https://trashfuture.co.uk/)
- First pancake theory: accepting that your first try at something is going to be crap
- Growth comes from working through the hard stuff
- [Sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition)
- Delegate conferences aren’t designed to foster deeper connection or change - Reminds me of a conversation with [James Lang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameslangresearch/) when curating Research by the Sea

Props to [Tom Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomscott/) for the recommendation.
