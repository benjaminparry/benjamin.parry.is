- [Polar Insights](https://www.polarinsight.com/) – B2B, expensive but James and co. are genuinely curious about studies, share really interesting domain insight and their face-to-face process is unmatched in the sector IMO.
- [Leftfield](https://leftfield.co.uk) – UK and international based, have delivered on some hard recruits.
- [People for Research](https://www.peopleforresearch.co.uk/) – Very well respected, they have specific panel for accessibility needs too. Expensive but come with lots of experience.
- [Roots Research](https://rootsresearch.co.uk/) – Local to Brighton, they’ve surprised me with a tough recruit in the past. They can go quiet when recruiting so if that worries you, it did me, you might need to poke them for an update. They also have a space to conduct research on site too.
