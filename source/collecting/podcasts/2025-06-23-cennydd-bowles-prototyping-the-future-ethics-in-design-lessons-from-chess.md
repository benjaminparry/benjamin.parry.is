> In this episode of the UX Fika podcast, I talk to Cennydd Bowles, technology ethicist, author of Future Ethics, and recently a Fulbright Scholar. Cennydd advises companies like Google, Mozilla, and the BBC on how to build more responsible, ethical, and inclusive technologies â€“ and in this conversation, which just like the rest of season 1 is from 2021, we unpack how and why that work is more urgent than ever.
