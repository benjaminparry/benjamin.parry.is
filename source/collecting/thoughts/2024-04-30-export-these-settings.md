posse: "You know what I’d really like to see more of with software that have a huge list of settings and customisations? An option to ‘export these settings’ as a json file. Rarely do I make the time to document my setup successes, I’m far more focused on doing the task at hand. The number of times I’ve had to figure things out again from scratch. This would make it much easier."
