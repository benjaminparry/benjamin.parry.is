posse: "Yesterday I gifted two hours of my time to the Lewes Library of Things (LLOT) https://www.leweslibraryofthings.org.uk/. LLOT is a community project that provides access to equipment on a loan basis free of charge irrespective of their financial circumstances. It also flips the consumer model of many people owning many things, to one thing being used by many people. Iâ€™m really excited to be getting involved in the sustainable and regenerative economy space, however small it may be."
