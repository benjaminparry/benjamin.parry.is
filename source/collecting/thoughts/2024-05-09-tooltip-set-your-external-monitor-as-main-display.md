    Do you use an external monitor as your main display with your Mac? Ever get tired of turning your neck to read notifications or other dialog windows on your laptop screen?

    Here’s how to fix that. Got to System Preferences » Displays » Arrange. You should see two rectangles that reflect the position of your screens, one has a light grey bar at the top. Drag the light grey bar from the laptop to the display.
