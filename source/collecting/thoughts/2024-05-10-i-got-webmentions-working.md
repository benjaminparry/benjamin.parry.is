     OMFG!!! I can finally say I’ve got #webmentions working on my #11ty website! I’ve tried loads of different tutorials but @chrisburnell@repc.co’s article https://chrisburnell.com/article/webmention-eleventy-setup/ and eleventy-cache-webmentions plugin https://chrisburnell.com/eleventy-cache-webmentions/ finally got me over the line. Thanks Chris!

     Now to ditch IFTTT and it’s shortened URLs and figure out POSSE auto-posting and write some ABSOLUTE BANGERS!!! // @henry@front-end.social
