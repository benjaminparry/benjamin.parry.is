posse: Spending the evening hanging out with the welcoming and curious folks at  IndieWeb Homebrew Website Club Europe/London https://events.indieweb.org/2024/05/homebrew-website-club-europe-london-HJs8USwnq2Ie. Lots of demos of recent website updates and projects. I got some useful clarification on the difference between cross-posting and syndication. We went down the webmention and micropub rabbit hole. I’ve come away even more excited and confident about what I’m doing. Thanks for making me feel so welcome!
