title: "A wild walk with Charlie"
date: '2024-06-05'
posse: I had a wonderful morning hike around with Charlie Peverett appreciating the flora and fauna of Lewes. We chatted about the upcoming Content Rising conference, some of the sustainability and regenerative projects he and Tasmin have been doing at Wilsome. Itâ€™s lovely to reconnect with people making some positive change in the world. Inspired!
