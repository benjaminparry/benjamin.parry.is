    After a bit of a hiatus I’ve got back into listening to podcasts. I’m using an old iPhone 4s as a dedicated device for audio brain food which offers me zero notification distraction. I’m also using @adactio’s https://huffduffer.com/ which allows me to subscribe to my chosen feed of podcasts via RSS. What I like most about Huffduffer is that I discover content from other users where I wouldn’t necessarily be looking. It’s a constant delight!
