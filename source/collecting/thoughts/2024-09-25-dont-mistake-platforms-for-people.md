    I responded to a post on LinkedIn asking for advice for making the experience more endurable. While I was writing it a few of pennies dropped about social networks.

    1. Don’t mistake the platform for the people on it.
    2. If we earnestly play the algorithm game and let it determine discovery, we’ll always be short-changed.
    3. Perhaps a more direct approach with people might be better?
