title: "A reminder."
date: '2024-11-06'
posse: A reminder that your community, with all of it's shades and beliefs, is the most important thing to focus on right now. Meet with people face to face and talk to them, whether you are part of their culture or not. That’s why I’m so glad to be spending this evening with Ladies That UX Brighton @LadiesthatUX_Br@hci.social 🏳️‍🌈💜
