    Reading @adactio@mastodon.social’s recent Going Offline post https://adactio.com/journal/21578 reminded me that I needed to fix my /offline/ page after I ported my site from Jekyll to Eleventy. I’ve also added j98@fosstodon.org and @trys@mastodon.social’s Utopia https://utopia.fyi albeit in a very minimal implementation. Of course now I want to refactor everything about my site!
