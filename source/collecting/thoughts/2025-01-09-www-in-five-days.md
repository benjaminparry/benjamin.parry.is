    Watching @rem@front-end.social and @adactio@mastodon.social walk us through building the World Wide Web in five days, from the comfort of my own home. We’ve come a long way! Thanks to Async for livestreaming! Do I spot @markboulton@typo.social and @briansuda@loðfíll.is in that pic too? Watch along here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XONerj4rE2I
