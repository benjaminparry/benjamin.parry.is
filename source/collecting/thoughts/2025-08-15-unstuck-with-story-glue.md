posse: This week I volunteered to give an update at Waitrose Online’s Design Deli, our weekly share-out of work in progress. Instead of a chain of ‘and then’ I decided to dig out my notes from Ben Sauer’s Practical Strategic Storytelling workshop and add some story glue for a more compelling story. If you’re looking to raise your storytelling game or your team’s I highly recommend getting touch with Ben! https://bensauer.net/workshop/
