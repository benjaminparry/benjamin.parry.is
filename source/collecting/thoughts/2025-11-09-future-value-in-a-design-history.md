posse: "Reading Benjy Stanton’s notes on working in the open https://www.benjystanton.co.uk/blog/govcamp-cymru-2025-working-in-the-open/ reminded me of design histories so now rewatching Paul Robert Lloyd’s UX London’s talk https://vimeo.com/841887944. I’m thinking this might be a potential solution for a challenge in my team."
