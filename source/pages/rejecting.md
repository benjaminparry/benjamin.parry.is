Things I disprove of.

## Companies

- Amazon – I’ve been boycotting the e-commerce behemoth since around 2012. I don’t think I need to explain why. Support your local businesses people, before they disappear.

## People

- Jeff Bezos – the man is pure unapologetic slime.
  - Exhibit A.1 _ [William Shatner’s earnest reflection of his first space travel experience, interrupted](https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1695687028762148864/pu/vid/1280x720/efhD-pisu3w5mj_B.mp4?tag=12)
  - Exhibit A.2 _ [Limmy’s commentary on the clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raYyKM9wQAc)
  - Exhibit B _ [wealth of Jeff Bezos visualised](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/)

## Language

- *“Nice to e-meet you”*
- *“Let‘s take this offline”*
