Absolutely fantastic documentary, I could have probrably watched another four hours and still wanted more. Having watched Alien and Aliens at such a young age it was obviously going to make a huge impression on me. What struck me duing the documentary was just how much theses two films, particularly Aliens, have shaped my values and world views.
