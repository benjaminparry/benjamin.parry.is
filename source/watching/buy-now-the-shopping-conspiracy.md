A little too stylised for my liking which was probably intentional. I think they missed a trick visulising the extent of what has been and still is being produced. I was left with a few thoughts. Even if we stopped today, how are we possibly going to manage the clean up of the total sum of material poison we have produced to date considering the contamination is at a microscopic level? We need to immediately dismantle fast fashion. The social media unboxing influencers profiting from consumerism voyeurism are abhorrent, especially ones targeted at children.
