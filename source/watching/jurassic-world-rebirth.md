Sheesh! Watched this after a so-called reliable source gave it a rave review. A good measure of a sofa movie is whether people ask for it to be paused when grabbing snacks. There were mant trips to the snack cupboard and no pausing. What annoyed me most was the broken sense of scale likely a result of the overuse of digital compositing and effects.
