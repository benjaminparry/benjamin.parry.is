A hundred and fourty nine minutes of seesawing tragedy, like an unflinching and unrelentless Instragram joy/doomscrolling feed. I had similar distain for the main character in The Masterpiece but I enjoyed this more. The 80s soundtrack worked as an unusal counterpoint to the period of the film. The time squashing was quite disorientating. Also… Tyler The Creator!
