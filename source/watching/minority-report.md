Better than I thought it was going to be. The story was much darker in theme than I was expecting too: the treatment of the female ‘precog’ by most characters was particularly unsettling. I’ve not read the book but I’m guessing the jet-pack pantomime what the point at which the screenplay deviated from the original story. *waves gloved-hands erratically in the air*
