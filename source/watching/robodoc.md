Some people grew up watching wholesome movies during thier childhood. Not me. I clearly remember the small kid’s room at the back of one of my friend’s house where their parents sat us down with microwaved popcorn, soft drinks and a VHS of Robocop. Wholely innapropriate but masively influencial, this film, alongside Alien and Aliens, shaped so much of how I see the world today. From my warped sense of humour, my love of satire, mistruct of authority figures and the lost art of critical thinking. An absolute trip!
