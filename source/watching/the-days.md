A graphic dramatisation of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that resulted in a near reactor meltdown at the privately owned TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. A story about the desire for absolutes while in a context of ambiguity, the facade of public performance and back-channel truths. I hadn’t appreciated the amount of symbolism in Shin Godzilla that reflected the events of this disaster, definitely time for a re-watch. As far as I’m aware, neither of these examples speak to the natural disaster simulation test results TEPCO were sitting on.
