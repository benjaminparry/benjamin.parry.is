I’ve been waiting for someone to satirise the superhero movie franchise for a long time and The Franchise delivered big time. Who better than Armando Iannucci and co. to make such scathing commentary on the vacuous re-hashed content and well-observed dysfunctional culture of the film and TV industry. Bravo! Please don’t spoil it by commissioning a second series!
