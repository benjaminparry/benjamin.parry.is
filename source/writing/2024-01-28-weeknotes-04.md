Sometimes there’s so much to talk about that you end up with nothing to say. Week 4 has been one of those weeks. Here’s a haiku from deep within my subconscious, heck knows what it means.

Driving while texting<br/>
Juggling hot potatoes<br/>
Disbelief and doubt

Time spent away from one screen was switched to another for a bit of salvation. Here’s a few things that have brought me joy.

Here’s a few things that have brought me joy.

- **Watching the Grand Sumo finals** live on Saturday and Sunday morning via an illegal YouTube livestream. I’ll recompense for my crime when I return to the land of the rising sun, paying a premium for a front row seat, exiting through the gift shop with a complete collection of Ura fan merchandise. #TeamUra
- **Making a home on my website** for what I’m [watching](/watching/), [reading](/reading/) and [listening](/listening/) to.
- **Reading Kaiju No.8 (manga)** at all sorts of weird and wonderful times of the day. Seeing as if my sleep patterns are completely borked at the moment I’ve retreated into the world of Japanese monsters.
