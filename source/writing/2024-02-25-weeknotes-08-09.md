Spring is just around the corner, I can sense it. New buds and flowers are beginning to sprout and the birds are busy chattering away with the gossip of a new season.

With the undeniable change around the corner, the urge to clean becomes too great to resist.

## Out with the old, in with the new

I took delivery of a new MacBook Air over a week ago. The new M1 chip is blazing fast. Web pages seem to load before clicking on a link. 11ty builds so quickly I have to double check for changes. To Hell with the Doherty Threshold!

Migrating files across was anything but fast. It turns out I’m as much a digital hoarder as I am a physical one. This gave me an opportunity to try out the drive I’ve setup on my local network. Both computers are now clean of files which I intend to keep that way. I also migrated my browser bookmarks to my website –[Focused](/focused/)– which is also set as my default new browser tab. I’m hoping this will help create some meaningful focus and distraction. Its a simple unordered list at the moment using the default template but have plans to make it more pleasing to the eye and play with the page hierarchy.

## When nature calls

- I went to see [Perfect Days](/watching/#perfect-days) the new Wim Wimners film about a Tokyo public toilet cleaner and his struggles with maintaining his peaceful lifestyle.
- The unique [public toilets featured in the film](https://www.spoon-tamago.com/tokyo-toilet/) were designed by a group of Japanese architects, there’s even an [organised tour](https://www.spoon-tamago.com/tokyo-toilet-tour/) to visit them.
- The theme of Japanese toilet culture reminded me of [Japan’s toilet God, kawaya kami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_god) and other [toilet themed yōkai](https://uncannyjapan.com/podcast/toilet-gods/).

- I’ve managed to maintain a rather good with learning Japanese this fortnight. [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/benjaminparry) has played a big part in keeping the daily habit but I do wonder if the overall gamification is a tad intense. Maintaining a streak, leagues and leaderboards, and time-limited point bonuses sometimes feel like a distraction to the primary goal of learning a new language. After a few lessons I’m left asking myself a question: Am I really making proper progress or falling victim to Goodhart’s Law?
