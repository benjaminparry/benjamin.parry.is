This week had been great. One of the best I can remember in a long time.

- The sun shone a lot.
- I met the wonderfully friendly, passionate and encouraging people at [Homebrew Website Club London/Europe](/collecting/thoughts/2024/05/homebrew-website-club-europe-london/) to discuss all things [IndieWeb](/tagging/IndieWeb).
- I swam a lot in Pells Pool, the Lewes lido.
- The day after attending [The Research Thingâ€™s Global Awareness Day meetup](/collecting/thoughts/2024/05/research-thing-global-accessibility-awareness-day-meetup/) I spent a few hours conducting an [accessibility audit](/collecting/thoughts/2024/05/an-accessibly-audit/) on my own site.
- I bought a couple of Japanese maples for my garden.
- I developed a method for setting more realistic goals and time estimates.
- I successfully folded a [cyclone, a complicated modular origami design](/collecting/thoughts/2024/05/may-origami-fold/) and ate teriyaki chicken and rice to celebrate.
- We played badminton as a family.
- I made delicious tonkotsu ramen.
