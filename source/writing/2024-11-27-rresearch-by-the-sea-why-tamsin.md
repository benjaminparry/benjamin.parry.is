There’s a moment during the design of a research study that always gives me pause for thought. The tension between three variables: the research goals, the duration of the session and the experience of the participant.

As I write a discussion guide, I assign time estimates against sections, individual questions and tasks. These aren’t set in stone though, after all a discussion guide is just that, a guide. Likewise, any skilled researcher should be constantly aware of a participant’s needs and experience, and adapt accordingly.

I still find this approach to be somewhat at odds with our user-centred practice. When dividing up time against a human being I can’t help but think of another guide. One that you might find hanging on the back wall of a butcher’s shop.

During a session, we do our best to put our participants at ease, build rapport and trust. We may not use the word ‘interview’ in our introduction but we ultimately lead the session: ask the majority of questions and, if required, segueing between topics. We tend to be sat opposite or adjacent to our participants, unintentionally creating a power dynamic. We host our sessions indoors, in unfamiliar surroundings with artificial light sounds and smells.

What if there was another way? What if we turned this largely static, unnatural and unfamiliar process on its head? What kind of stories would be shared with us? How might these stories help us shape the future?

I’m delighted that Tamsin is joining us at [Research by the Sea](https://researchbythesea.com/) to explore some of these themes and questions. She’ll outline a research method that will help us push back against destructive norms and help us on our first steps toward an inclusive and restorative future practice.
